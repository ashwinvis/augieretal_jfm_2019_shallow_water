Todo
----

- figure 1: label, all black curves in contrast to what is written in the
  caption.

- figure 2: texts too small (they have to be nearly as big as the text in the
  caption).

- figure 3: it has to be as nice as in the old version.

- figure 4: OK. we put the old figure.

- figure 5 (Time- and space-averaged energy): not included in the .tex file and
  in the repository. Why ?

- figure 6 (Compensated energy spectra versus $k/k_f$ for different wave speeds
  $c$.): not included in the .tex file and in the repository. Why ?

- figure 7: Good in terms of content but we have to improve the quality! Text
  too small, lines too big, bad resolution on the screen.

- figure 8: text slightly too small.

- figure 9: not included. Why ?

- figure 10: not included. Why ?

- figure 11: nearly OK. It can be nicer (larger text, ylabel, ...).

- figure 12: nearly OK but why is there an empty axis ?

- figure 13: not included. Why ?
